I want to catch up on some things by learning through ML projects

#Project 1:Use case: Iris flower classification

Description: This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower


Skill level: Beginner

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset


#Project 2: Kaggle Depression Dataset
Aim: This is just data exploration and visualization of the features in the dataset. I am trying my hands on different plots to see relationships existing amongst these features.
